West African peanut soup is a simple soup with big flavor. This is the first vegan recipe I tried, and fell in love with.

This soup comes together easily with basic pantry items.

It's perfect to leave simmering, with little supervision needed.

The peanut butter gives this soup a rich, creamy texture. The combination of the peanut butter and rice is a complete protein. And the collard greens provide you with plenty of vitamin K, A, and C.
