It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when considering taking up a plant based diet. Your mind seem to be filled with “I can’t eat…”, that you forget all the delicious plant based food you’ve been neglecting for years. This recipe is a perfect example of a combination that I had been missing my entire life. The first vegan recipe I tried taught me a lot about what I had been missing before I put much thought into what entered my body. I find it fitting that this is the first recipe posted on Plate of Plants. If you think this seems like an odd combination, you’d be right. Tomatoes and peanut butter, yes indeed! Don’t bash it until you try it. When served with rice this meal provides you with a complete protein.
