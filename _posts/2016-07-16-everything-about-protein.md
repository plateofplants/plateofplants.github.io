Surprisingly the first questions everyone asks when you tell them you are going to stop eating animal products is, where will you get your protein? The truth is not many people know why we need protein, how we get it, or how much we actually need. Consider this your crash coarse, and guide that you can show any worrying friends or family.

So, if you live in any westernized country you probably know that the general publics perceptions is meat = protein, or maybe Cheese, milk, egg = protein. What do you do if you decide to abandoned those food though? You learn. You learn very fast that almost everything you eat has protein in it. But is that enough? Almost certainly, yes. As long as your are eating a variety of plants, you are probably getting everything you need. Probably is not a word I trust when it comes to nourishing my body though, and neither shall you. If anything, you need to know about protein just so your mom doesn’t worry.

Lets make this simple. Protein is needed to rebuild, muscles and tissues throughout your body. Protein is a chain of nine essential amino acids. You need all nine amino acids for protein to be considered a “complete protein or one that can be used by the human body. This is where things get tricky. Almost all animal products already contain a complete protein. Plants however don’t usually have all nine essential amino acids. To make sure you are getting complete proteins you can eat a plant that you know contains a complete protein.

## Complete proteins

- Quinoa
- Buckwheat (look into using soba noodles)
- Soy (edamame, tofu, tempeh)
- Chia (chia puddings=yum)
- Hemp seed
- Legume (beans, lentils, peanuts) + Grain (wheat, rice, corn)

These foods are so easy to incorporate if you aren’t already enjoying them! You also don’t need to eat a complete protein for every meal. I like to make sure I am getting at least one throughout the coarse of the day. Eating massive amounts of proteins is not necessary for your body to function properly. When you eat meat you are eating protein, fat, fat and a few minerals. When you eat plants you are giving your body, protein, carbohydrates, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. You give your body so much more when you start eating primarily plant food.
