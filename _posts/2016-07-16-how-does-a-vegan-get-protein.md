The first questions everyone asks when you tell them you are going to stop eating animal products is, where will you get your protein? It is a valid question, and you need to know the answer. Plants can provide you with all the protein you need.

So the general publics perceptions is meat = protein, or maybe Cheese, milk, egg = protein.  No one is talking about all the protein in kale. That's because plants don't have much protein when you compare them to meat. We have so many misconceptions about how much we need and why we need it. We don't need protein to feel full(eat 5lb of vegetables and see if you're still hungry). We need protein because it builds and repairs our cells, therefore our bodies.

Protein is a chain of nine essential amino acids. You need all nine amino acids for protein to be considered a “complete protein" or one that can be used by the human body. Plants however don’t always have all nine essential amino acids. I suggest adding plants that contain complete proteins to your diet.

## Complete proteins

* Quinoa
* Buckwheat (look into using soba noodles)
* Soy (edamame, tofu, tempeh)
* Chia (chia puddings=yum)
* Hemp seed
* Legume (beans, lentils, peanuts) + Grain (wheat, rice, corn)

These foods are so easy to incorporate if you aren’t already enjoying them! You also don’t need to eat a complete protein for every meal. I like to make sure I am getting at least one throughout the coarse of the day. Even if you are not eating any of these, you are probably getting complete proteins already. As long as you are eating a wide variety of plants(they all contain different amino acids).
