I have NOT always loved tofu. Straight out of the package, it can be a flavorless mess. However, learning to make tofu taste great is really as easy as one, two, three. Press it, marinade it, and cook it. When prepared correctly tofu makes a great meat replacement.
The things I love about tofu are:
- neutral flavor
- texture can vary
- complete protein

Now let learn how to make this block of soy irresistible!

## Pressing

Pressing tofu is necessary if you want it to take on a texture that is firm, not mushy. This step is necessary, even if buying "extra firm" tofu in the store. Tofu is usually packed in water and some of that water is absorbed. Pressing it is a simple step that will make a world of difference.
To press your tofu:
- Remove it from the package
- Dump out all of the water
- Wrap tofu with an absorbent towel and place on a small plate.
- Place a heavy object on the tofu.
I suggest leaving it this way for several hours (or overnight). However, 20-30 minutes is enough time to remove a lot of the water. The longer, the better. I usually prep my veggies while it is pressing. Good heavy objects include: cast iron skillet, a sealed container filled with water, or if pressing overnight: a bottle of orange juice, filtered water picture, or your milk alternative.

## Flavoring

Tofu on its own, is pretty bland. You want to infuse flavor into it. With tofu the best way to do this is with a liquid. Soy sauce works great for a lot of recipes. If you want to use dried spices just stir in enough water to make it pourable. 15-20 minutes is usually long enough to soak up the goodness.

## Cooking

Tofu can be baked, grilled, or fried to fit any recipe. The options are endless!
