On the farm where I grew up there were always a few weeks of summer where we would get bombarded with summer squash. I remember those times fondly. When I saw squash and zucchini at the farmers market I knew I could make something delicious with it. This recipe put my spin on the way my mom used to prepare it for us. Just a few ingredients, a few minutes to prepare, and lots of nutrition. You’ll have the perfect side dish or light lunch in no time!

# Summer Squash Sauté

2 large summer squash
1 T olive oil
2 T nutritional yeast flakes
1/3 C sunflower seeds
Salt & Pepper

1. Heat oil in a large skillet. While oil is heating slice your squash into 1/8 in chips.
2. When oil is shimmering, add squash. Leave them alone for a few minutes, then start flipping them over. Try to get them all to have some time on the bottom of the pan.
3. Once they are golden, add the nutritional yeast flakes, and S & P, to taste, stir, and cook for 1 min.
4. Just before serving, add the sunflower seeds.
