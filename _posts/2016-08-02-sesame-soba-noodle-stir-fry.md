There are so many reasons to love this dish. It has an irresistibly creamy and flavorful sauce that will have you licking your bowl. The vegetables give each bite different flavor combinations. The soba noodles, which are made from buckwheat flour, provide you with a complete protein. It’s a crowd pleaser. One of my favorite things about this dish is that the vegetables you use are completely interchangeable. That the beauty of stir fry, just add the veggies you have on hand. This meal comes together quickly, perfect for a busy night!

## Sesame soba noodle stir fry

* 1/3 C cashew butter

1. Cook noodles according to package directions. Leave noodles in colander.
2. Heat oil in wok, over med-low heat. Once hot, add garlic and ginger. Stir fry for 1 minute.
3. Adjust heat to medium. Add vegetable, stir fry 5-7 min. While vegetables cook, whisk together sauce ingredients.
4. Pour sauce over vegetables. Run hot water over the noodles to ensure they don’t stick together. Add the noodles, and stir everything together. Let simmer 3-5 minutes, or until sauce has thickened a bit.

\*If you can't find soba noodles, rice noodles are the best substitution.
