Something about blueberry muffins is so addictive. These muffins are the perfect breakfast, but you will probably end up snacking  on them throughout the day. The mint adds freshness to this classic recipe (although they taste great without it too). These muffins are also vegan, and don’t use processed sugars, so they are much much better for you. I love to eat these straight out of the oven. The blueberries taste amazing when they are warm.

## Blueberry mint muffins

* 1/2 C cashew milk
* 1/2 tsp vinegar
* 1/4 C vegan margarine, melted
* 1/2 C unsweetened applesauce
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1/2 C honey or agave
* 2 C unbleached flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 C fresh blueberries
* 3 tbsp fresh mint, chopped

1. Preheat oven to 375°. Grease a muffin tin.
2. Mix cashew milk with vinegar to create vegan buttermilk.
3. In a separate bowl, mix flour, baking powder, and salt.
4. Add the rest of the wet ingredients into the cashew milk mixture. Stir until well combine.
5. Add flour mixture and stir until you see the flour has been worked in, you will still have lumps. Gently stir in blueberries and mint
6. Fill muffin cups about 3/4 full. Bake for 22-25 minutes. Let cool and enjoy!
