I am in LOVE with this breakfast right now. I love packing in all those veggies this early in the day. It's tofu, but any egg-eater will enjoy this dish. The tofu get lots of flavor from cooking in the the seasonings.  Plus tofu has zero cholesterol, yay happy heart! You can get creative with this recipe by changing the vegetables or the seasonings. Tofu takes on any flavor you throw at it, so this is a great recipe to get creative with. I often add cumin and chili powder for a Mexican flare!
This recipe comes together quickly in the morning, especially if you pre-chop your veggies and press your tofu overnight.

I hope you enjoy this recipe. Please tell me blow in the comments if you tried it. Donâ€™t forget to subscribe.
