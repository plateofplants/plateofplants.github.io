In November 2015 Bryce and I moved to Florida. We went for the warm weather, but we will be back for the delicious produce, and vibrant latin culture. On our way to Everglades National Park we saw some delicious looking food stands, some  selling tamales. Although we didnâ€™t find any vegan tamales anywhere. That trip inspired me to create this recipe.

Tamales have a unique flavor from being cooked in a corn husk. I have been trying to cut down on adding fat to meals in the form of oil and vegan butter. This vegan version has significantly less fat in it than traditional tamales and still has so much flavor!

If you haven't eaten tempeh before, you are going to fall in love with this it immediately. Tempeh  is a made from fermented soybeans and originally comes from Indonesia. It is usually found in stores near the tofu.

If you tried this recipe let me know below.

Thanks for stopping by, happy cooking!

## Vegan Tempeh Tamales

Recipe by: Hannah<br>
Serves: 4<br>
Prep time: 30 minutes<br>
Cook time: 1 hour<br>
Total time: 1 hour 30 minutes

### Filling
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1/2 green pepper
* 1/2 onion
* 8 oz tempeh
* 1/2 tsp chili powder
* 1 tsp cumin
* 2/3 cup salsa
* 1 cup tomato sauce

### Masa
* 2 cups masa flour
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 4 tbsp vegan margarine
* 2 cups vegetable broth

* 40 corn husks
* avocado
* cilantro
* lime

1. Soak corn husks in hot water for 20 min.
2. While corn husks soak, prepare filling. Heat oil and add chopped green pepper and onion. Cook until tender, 3-5 minutes. Add tempeh and garlic and cook on low until tempeh starts to get crispy on the outside, 5 min. Stir in chili powder and cumin, cook 30 sec. Add salsa and tomato sauce, simmer for 5 minutes. Let cool.
3. Prepare masa. Mix masa flour, salt, and baking powder. Using pastry blender, cut in vegan margarine. Add broth until a soft dough is formed.
4. Dry the corn husks. Take the smaller husks and tear into ribbons.
5. To assemble the tamales: Lay out a corn husk with the smooth side facing up. Add a small patty shape of masa dough and a heaping tablespoon of filling near the bottom(see picture). Wrap the sides of the corn in and fold the top down. Tie closed with corn husk ribbon.
6. Steam assembled tamales for one hour. You know they are done when you unwrap one and the masa doesn't stick to the corn husk. Serve with fresh slices of avocado, cilantro, and lime juice.
