Sushi is fun! It’s fun to make, fun to eat, it’s even fun to say. So are you ready to have some fun?

The key to great sushi is great sushi rice, so be sure to follow the method exactly. I always use short grain brown rice instead of white sushi rice. Anytime you have the choice between a whole grain or a refined “white” grain, go for the whole grain. You will feel the difference in energy levels when you give your body lots of nutrition through whole plant foods.

For years I never attempted to make my own sushi. I always though it required extra gadgets and special skills, but that’s just not true. In fact I’m so against excessive kitchen gadgets that I made sure there was a way to make it without a bamboo mat. The key is to make smaller sushi rolls. I found “snack size” nori sheets, but you can also cut a regular size nori sheet in half so you can manage it without needing a mat. I think nori is fantastic because it imparts the sea flavor without using fish.

You can put a huge variety of vegetables in these sushi rolls. I always add marinated tofu for bonus flavor, and  the avocado for a creamy texture in mine, but the vegetables can be used interchangeably with any others you have on hand. This dish is perfect for lunch (especially packed lunches), appetizers, or you can make a variety of rolls and have a sushi night.

## Rainbow Sushi Rolls

Recipe by: Hannah<br>
Serves: 2<br>
Prep time: 10 minutes<br>
Cook time: 35 minutes<br>
Total time: 45 minutes

* 2/3 cup short grain brown rice
* 1 cup water
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 4 nori sheets
* 6 oz extra firm tofu, pressed
* 2 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp rice vinegar
* 1 tsp chili sauce
* 1 avocado
* 1/2 cup carrot matchsticks
* 1/2 cup red bell pepper, sliced
* 1/2 cup chopped red cabbage

1. Bring water to boil in small saucepan. Add rice and simmer 35 min over low heat, covered, occasionally checking water level, adding more if necessary. After 35 min, remove from heat, add rice vinegar, stir, replace cover, and let cool.
2. While rice is cooking, marinate your tofu. Cut the tofu into strips and add to a small bowl with the soy sauce, 1 tsp rice vinegar, and chili sauce. Let mixture marinate 20 min, stirring occasionally.
3. Assemble sushi: lay nori sheet vertically with the rough side up. Wet your hands (so rice doesn’t stick to them). Taking small handfuls of rice form a layer on your nori sheet that spans one inch from the bottom, to 3 inches from the top (see pics). Neatly stack tofu, avocado, carrot, red pepper, and cabbage on the rice, one inch from bottom of nori (see pics).
4. Roll sushi: dip fingers in water, wet the underside of the bottom inch of nori, and the top of nori with no rice on it. Using both hands, bring bottom of nori sheet over the vegetables and roll up, keeping it as tight as possible.
5. Using an extremely sharp knife, cut each roll into 4 pieces. Serve with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi.
