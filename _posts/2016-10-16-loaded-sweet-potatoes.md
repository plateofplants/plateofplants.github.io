Who doesn’t love a sweet potato? The more you eat them the more you’ll love them. Sweet potatoes taste amazing on their own and they barely even need salt. With the addition of more fresh ingredients you can have a super easy, satisfying, and healthy dinner. This meal is made from all whole foods. When you cook this way you’ll feel great about what you’re eating and you’ll have way more energy.

An ingredient I’ve recently started using is jicama. I can’t believe I had never used it before this season! Jicama is such a versatile ingredient because it is great cooked or raw. I feel like jicama tastes like a mix between an apple and a potato. In this recipe I used it in a raw jicama slaw on top of the loaded sweet potatoes.

These sweet potatoes are best when they are served with avocado. The creamy texture and flavor makes it that much better. I usually pile avocado on top of the jicama slaw and eat it all together.

## Loaded Sweet Potatoes

Recipe by: Hannah<br>
Serves: 4<br>
Prep time: 5 minutes<br>
Cook time: 35 minutes<br>
Total time: 40 minutes

* 2 sweet potatoes
* 1 15 oz can black beans
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1 cup jicama
* 1/2 cup red onion
* 1/3 cup cilantro, chopped
* 1/2 lime, juiced
* 1 avocado

1. Preheat oven to 350°. Slice sweet potatoes in half lengthwise, and place cut side down on parchment lined baking sheet. Bake 25-30 min, until tender. Remove and let cool 5 minutes.
2. While sweet potatoes are baking, drain and rinse black beans. Mix black beans, garlic powder, cumin, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.
3.  Once potatoes have cooled, carefully flip them over, so they are skin side down. Using a fork score and mash the potato. Try to open the potato up so there is room for the beans.
4.  Fill the sweet potatoes with the black beans, and return to the oven for 10 minutes.
5.  While the potatoes bake, prepare the jicama slaw. Slice jicama into matchsticks and slice onion very thin. In a bowl stir together jicama, onion, cilantro, lime juice, and salt and pepper.
6.  Use a spatula to press down on each sweet potato. This flattens them so you can now pile on the jicama slaw.
7.  Serve with sliced avocado on the side or right on top!
