Making guacamole at home is as easy as cutting up a few vegetables and mixing them in a bowl together. It only takes a couple minutes.  Plus, it’s more affordable then store bought varieties, which often have added processed ingredients.

I make this recipe a few times a week because I put it on everything! It’s perfect as a dip, or to put on top of all your favorite food.
