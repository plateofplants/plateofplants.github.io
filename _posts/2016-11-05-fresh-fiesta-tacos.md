Celebrate this taco Tuesday in style. Impress your friends, family, and even yourself by making these tacos completely from scratch. Imagine homemade tortillas stuffed full of refried black beans, fiesta rice, and [chunky guacamole](http://plateofplants.com/chunky-guacamole). Is your mouth watering yet?

If you have never made your own tortillas, it is time to start. They are so easy and simple to make. Homemade tortillas are made from masa, water, and salt. That is all you need. You will be wondering why you ever ate the ultra-processed store bought varieties. In this recipe I cook my tortillas in the oven, although it is traditional to cook them on the stovetop. I did this to avoid using oil. No oil was used in the making of this recipe. That means you can feel great about eating a meal filled with only nutritious whole foods.

## Fresh Fiesta Tacos

Recipe by: Hannah<br>
Serves: 3<br>
Prep time: 10 minutes<br>
Cook time: 15 minutes<br>
Total time: 25 minutes

### Tortillas
* 2 cups masa harina
* 1 1/2 cups water
* 1 tsp salt

### Refried Black Beans
* 1 14 oz. can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 2-3 tbsp vegetable broth
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp chili powder
* 1/4 tsp onion powder

### Fiesta Rice
* 1 1/2 cups cooked brown rice
* 1/2 cup salsa

### Additional Toppings
* [chunky guacamole](http://plateofplants.com/chunky-guacamole)
* fajita vegetables
* corn
* shredded lettuce
* chopped cilantro

### Make Tortillas:
1. In a large bowl mix together all ingredients. Add more water, one tablespoon at a time if dough seems too dry.  
2. Divide the dough into 8 equally sized balls. Cut a gallon sized zipper bag down the sides. Place one of the balls of dough in the center of the plastic bag. Press under a heavy cast iron pot, or a tortilla press if you have one.
3. Place pressed tortillas in a single layer on a parchment lined baking sheet. Bake at 375Â° for 7 minutes, flip, and bake another 7 minutes.
4. Once you remove the tortillas from the oven, immediately stack them up and wrap them in a dish towel. This allows them to steam, and maintain their flexibility.

### Make Tacos
1. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until browned, about 2 minutes. Add the black beans, spices, and broth, let cook 2 minutes.
2. Mash the mixture to desired consistency. Add more broth if necessary.
3. Add cooked brown rice and salsa to a pan and warm over medium heat.
4. Assemble tacos by spooning refried black beans and fiesta rice onto a fresh tortilla. Finish with additional toppings and a squeeze of lime juice.
