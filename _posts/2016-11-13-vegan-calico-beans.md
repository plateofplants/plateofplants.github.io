One of my greatest cooking inspirations is my dear Grandma. From a very young age most of my memories involving food and cooking took place in her kitchen. My Grandma certainly loved to spoil us with treats like her delicious peach pie. Anyone who came over for dinner was treated to a homemade feast. Before I could see over the counter, I remember standing on a stool and helping her measure ingredients. This recipe is in honor of my Grandma who was laid to rest this past week.

Calico beans was one of her favorite recipes. Anyone who knew my grandma knew that she added sugar to everything, so it’s no surprise these beans are quite sweet, except instead I used maple syrup to sweeten it **naturally**. I also made the recipe vegan by using tofu.
