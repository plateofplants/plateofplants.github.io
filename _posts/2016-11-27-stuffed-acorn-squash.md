Acorn squash are like natures little bowls. They are the perfect shape to stuff full of your holiday favorites. I chose to fill mine with a delicious sausage spiced tempeh, topped with some simple homemade stuffing. This recipe has so many spices and herbs added to it that it is extremely flavorful, without adding any oil. There is no need to use fat to add flavor when you have an arsenal of spices ready to go! This is truly a healthy holiday meal you can feel good about.

## Stuffed Acorn Squash

Recipe by: Hannah<br>
Serves: 4<br>
Prep time: 30 minutes<br>
Cook time: 18 minutes<br>
Total time: 48 minutes

### Ingredients

* 1 acorn squash
* 8 oz package tempeh
* 2 Tbsp fresh sage, chopped
* 1/2 tsp each: fennel seeds, garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, oregano, thyme, marjoram
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 flax egg (1 Tbsp flax meal + 2 1/2 Tbsp water)

### Stuffing

* 1 medium onion
* 2 stalks celery
* 1 1/2 Tbsp fresh sage
* 1 Tbsp fresh thyme
* 1 Tbsp fresh rosemary
* 4 cups bread cubes, dried (see notes)
* 1-1 1/2 cups broth
* salt and pepper

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°. Cut squash in half and scoop out seeds. Cut a little off the bottom of each half so it can sit flat. Place on parchment paper lined baking sheet and bake 20 minutes.
2. While squash is in the oven, make the tempeh sausage. Chop the tempeh and add it to a small bowl along with sage, fennel seeds, garlic powder, paprika, chili powder, oregano, thyme, marjoram, salt, and flax egg.
3. After 20 minutes remove squash from oven and fill 3/4 full with tempeh mixture. Return to oven for another 15 minutes.
4. Make your stuffing. Heat a pot over medium heat. Add onion and celery and cook for 5-7 minutes until soft. Add herbs and bread cubes, stir. Slowly pour in broth until bread has fully absorbed and not dry anywhere. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
5. Remove squash from the oven. Fill with stuffing until heaping. Return to the oven for 20 more minutes. Let cool and enjoy.

Notes:

* You can use two small acorn squash that won't get filled as full.
* To dry your bread cubes: Heat your oven to 200° and place cubes on a baking sheet. Place in oven and check every 5 minutes. When they feel completely dry they are ready.
