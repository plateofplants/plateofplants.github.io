I will be the first to admit that I love potatoes. This gardeners pie is topped with a thick layer of creamy mashed potatoes, with a golden brown top. It's to die for! Gardener's pie (shepard's pie for us veg folk) is filled with all the delicious ingredients that a gardener would have ready this time of year. You will love the flavor of the parsnips in this dish (and everything else).

There is nothing better than a home cooked meal from scratch. Although this recipe takes a lot of time it is well worth it!

## Gardener’s Pie

Recipe by: Hannah<br>
Serves: 6<br>
Prep time: 15 minutes<br>
Cook time: 45 minutes<br>
Total time: 1 hour

### Ingredients

* 4 med russet potatoes
* 1/4 cup plant based milk
* 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1/2 med onion
* 3 carrots
* 2 parsnips
* 1 stalk celery
* 1/2 cup pearl barley
* 4 cups vegetable broth
* 2 tsp thyme
* 1 tsp rosemary
* 2 Tbsp flour
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp pepper

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°. Bring a large pot of water to a boil while you peel and quarter potatoes. Once water is boiling, add potatoes and boil for 15 minutes, or until very soft. Drain potatoes and return them to the pot. Add the plant based milk, nutritional yeast, and salt and pepper to taste. Mash potatoes.
2. Chop onion, carrots, parsnips, and celery, then add to a hot cast iron pot. Cook for 5 minutes (if vegetables begin to stick, add a splash of water), then add garlic cook for 2 more minutes. Add pearl barley, broth, thyme, and rosemary, simmer 25 minutes.  
3. Stir in flour. If your pot is dry at the bottom add 2-5 Tbsp water. The barley will continue to absorb water in the oven. Spread mashed potatoes over the top of the barley mixture.
4. Place pot in heated oven and cook for 30 minutes. To make the top extra golden, turn your oven to broil and cook 3-5 more minutes. Watch carefully so it doesn't burn.
