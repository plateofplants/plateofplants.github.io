Butternut squash soup was something I used to buy at the store. That was until I realized just how easy it was to make myself at home. It basically requires enough skill to cut vegetables and operate a blender. Plus, when you make it yourself you can choose to flavor it any way you want. This recipe is pretty basic and could definitely take on some holiday spices this time of year. Cinnamon and nutmeg both pair well with squash and would make a lovely addition to this basic recipe.

This soup is perfect for those who cook without oil. When you add onions into a hot pan they create their own moisture and do not stick to the pan. If you have bad luck though, and your onions are sticking, you can just add a little bit of water to the pan and stir them around. The water will become steam soon enough and your recipe will turn out perfect!

This soup would also be great to make for anyone who has a cold. Onions are antiviral. Garlic is an extremely powerful healer when eaten raw. In this recipe, the garlic is cooked which means most of the healing power is gone. So if you have a cold that you are trying to get rid of try munching on a clove of raw garlic while you are cooking. It won’t be pleasant, but you will be feeling better before you know it. Ginger also has healing power as an anti-inflammatory, so it will help with sore throats. The butternut squash is packed full of potassium, vitamin C, and vitamin A.

The ingredients in this recipes mean it is food you can be proud of. You can serve this food to your friends and family knowing this soup will have a positive impact on their health. Taking the time to cook food that nourishes your body will always be worth it in the long run.
