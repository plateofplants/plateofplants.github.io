The holidays are such a fun time of year. So many of my favorite traditions seem to revolve around food. That can make it really difficult to stay true to your healthy eating habits. One of the hardest things for me to avoid are sweets. There are cookies and candies everywhere. I knew I needed to make my own so I could be sure they were made with ingredients I want to eat, and none I don't. Plus, I’m a sucker for traditions, so nothing was going to stop me from making Christmas cookies. I was determined to make a batch of cookies that I am proud of. These are the cookies I came up with.

Some important things to keep in mind while making this recipe would be to make sure you refrigerate your dough for at least 4 hours before rolling it. You also want to keep the dough covered and cool at all times. Keeping the dough covered makes sure it won’t dry out while you aren’t using it. Keeping it cool helps the dough be less sticky when it is rolled out, and it makes it easier to work with. Be sure to return the covered bowl of dough to the fridge when you are rolling out the other portions. When rolling out the dough you want to be sure you are placing it on a well floured surface so your dough doesn't stick. With these tips your cookies will turn out perfect!

These gingerbread cookies are packed full of health benefits. Yes, you read that sentence correctly. Molasses is full minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, and vitamin B6. Ginger is an anti-inflammatory and can help with everything from a sore throat to an upset stomach. Cinnamon helps lower blood sugar and can prevent tooth decay. These cookies are also made without oil or sugar. They are part of a whole food, plant-based diet.

Give your family and friends cookies that they can enjoy without guilt. This recipe spreads good health to all those you love. If you tried this recipe, let me know in the comments below. Happy holidays!
