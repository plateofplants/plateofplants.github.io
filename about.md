### More about Hannah…

Hannah grew up in rural Michigan. After graduating college she moved to California, then Virginia. In Spring 2015 she quit her job and decided to travel the United States with her boyfriend for the next several months. She lived in a tent until fall, camping in nearly every region. After purchasing a 1966 vintage trailer and restoring it they spent the winter in Florida. She currently resides in Durham, NC. When she isn’t busy moving, Hannah loves cooking and crafting. She also spends a lot of time outside, hiking, camping, or foraging.

### Why vegan?

I read a book called “The China Study” by T. Colin Campbell.
