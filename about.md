### More about Hannah…

#### I’m Hannah and I’m on a quest to make the best tasting plant-based food ever. I’m a self taught cook who loves to experiment in the kitchen. About 2 years ago I became increasingly aware of the importance of diet on all aspects of life. I’ve been cooking and eating healthier ever since. I create simple recipes to help anyone start eating a healthy, and delicious plant based diet.

I grew up in a rural area of Michigan. I always loved to help out in the kitchen when I was young. It was when I moved to the other side of the country, that my love for cooking started to bloom. Then I began reading articles and watching documentaries that made me question my eating choices. That is when I started reading the ingredients on everything I buy.

Shortly after I cut out processed food and sugar, I departed on a year long camping trip around the United States. Living out of a cooler meant eating less animal products so I was well prepared for my next transition. I committed to a plant based diet before chapter two of “The China Study” By T. Colin Campbell and Thomas M. Campbell.

“If it doesn’t taste good we’re not going to stick with it.” That is what my boyfriend, Bryce, said when I first started telling him about changes I wanted to make to our diet. This has stuck with me. I don’t ever want to feel like I’m unsatisfied by the food I’m eating. That’s why the recipes I create are always packed with flavor!

When I’m not in the kitchen, I love to go camping, hiking, and forage for wild ingredients while I’m out there. I often find delicious edible wild mushrooms which make a great addition to a plant based diet. I also enjoy road tripping around the country with Bryce. We follow our favorite musicians and visit as many national parks as possible. Our adorable cat, Jimothy, also comes along for the ride!
